# git-credential-1password

This is a simple Git credential helper that uses the [1Password](https://1password.com/) password manager to retrieve credentials.

During my professional work, I came across git servers that did not support SSH and, as a result, did not support SSH keys.
In order to avoid [storing passwords in plaintext](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35942754/how-can-i-save-username-and-password-in-git/35942890#35942890)
in the git configuration, I decided to use a password manager to save my credentials.

Seriously, do not do that! any run-away-script could grab these and exfiltrate them in various ways, since the `.gitconfig` is
usually in a well-defined place.

## üîê Features

This credential helper expects a 1Password item with the following fields:

- `username`: The username to use for authentication.
- `password`: The password to use for authentication, could also be a personal access token.

Item name must the same as the hostname of the repository you are authenticating against, e.g. `github.com` or
`gitlab.example.net`. If the credentials are unknown, a new item will be created.

The [arguments](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials) `get`, `store`, and `erase` are supported.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Danger: `erase` will remove the 1Password item matching the hostname! It's disabled by default, see optional configuration**

### üöß Why Go?

It's portable and very lightweight, so it's easy to build and run on different systems. Also it's a compiled language,
so you don't have to worry about the user having the correct runtime installed.

### üì¶ Why no binary releases?

I don't want to distribute binaries that could be used to steal your 1Password data and i don't want you to have to trust me.

The program logic is very simple and commented, so you can easily audit the code.

Also it's effort to ensure that builds run on different systems, signing binaries and so on.

### üîÑ Alternatives?

If your target system uses Oauth, you might want to try [git-credential-oauth](https://github.com/hickford/git-credential-oauth),
although it is a bit more complex to setup.

## üèóÔ∏è Installation

Clone this repository and build the binary, simplest way could be:

```bash
go build -o git-credential-1password
```

Then copy the binary to a directory in your PATH.

You must have installed and configured the [1Password CLI](https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/)
for this to work.

You can test the 1Password CLI by running:

```bash
op whoami
```

This should prompt you to unlock your vault and then print account information.

This helper has no external dependencies other than the 1Password CLI.

Verify that `git` can find the helper by running:

```bash
git credential-1password
```

If you have problems, make sure that the binary is [located in the path](https://superuser.com/a/284351/62691) and
[is executable](https://askubuntu.com/a/229592/18504).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

*Fun fact: Did you know that you can use the [default Golang flags](https://www.antoniojgutierrez.com/posts/2021-05-14-short-and-long-options-in-go-flags-pkg/) with `-` and `--`? Well, now you do!*

To use this credential helper, you need to configure Git to use it. You can do this by running:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper "1password"
```

Depending on your setup, it might be a better strategy to just set it as helper for a single host:

```bash
git config --global credential.https://gitlab.example.net.helper "1password"
```

Then, when you push to a repository that requires authentication, 1Password will prompt you to unlock your vault and will
then use the credentials stored in the item with the same name as the hostname.

*Note: Depending on your OS, you might get prompted in different ways for your credentials.*

## Optional Configuration

If you want to use a specific account or vault, you can add `--account` and/or `--vault` to the command line arguments. If omitted,
the default account and vault will be used.

```bash

`erase` is disabled by default, as it will remove the matching 1Password item. If you want to enable it, you can
add `-erase=true` to the command line arguments.

```bash
git config --global credential.helper "1password --erase=true"
```

You can also add a `--prefix` argument, to prefix all item names with a specific string. (i.e. use `--prefix="Git: "` to use `Git: gitlab.com` as the item name instead of `gitlab.com`).

```bash
git config --global credential.helper "1password --prefix='Git: '"
```

In case your `op` binary is not in the PATH, you can use the `--op` argument to specify the path to the `op` binary.

```bash
git config --global credential.helper "1password --op='/usr/local/bin/op'"
```

*Note: On Windows, you must use forward slashes `/` in the path, e.g., `C:/temp/op.exe`, for Git to provide it to the credential helper.*

## How items in 1Password items are selected

### Reading credentials

The helper looks for items

- in the selected Vault and Account
- AND that have the tag `git-credential-1password`
- AND that match protocol and host of the requested URL in the `url` field

### Storing credentials

- When the helper can find an item according to the rules above, it will update the `username` and `password` fields of the item if they changed.
- Otherwise, it will create a new item with `url`, `username`, `password` fields, a `git-credential-1password` tag.
